Description: Provides quantification tools for xray data.
    High resolution xray data and dynamic xray data are 
    widely available and encode many levels of anatomy and
    physiology.  Dynamic chest radiography is particularly 
    valuable because it encodes not only static anatomy but 
    also the motion of heart, lungs and diaphragm as well as
    the potential for gaining insight into lung vasculature.
    This package explors quantification of this type of data.
